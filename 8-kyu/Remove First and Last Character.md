# Remove First and Last Character

### Task:

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. 

You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

```python
def remove_char(s):
    return s[1:-1]
```
