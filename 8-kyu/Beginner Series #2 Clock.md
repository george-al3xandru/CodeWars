# Beginner Series # 2 Clock

Clock shows 'h' hours, 'm' minutes and 's' seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.


Example:

```
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1
result = 61000
```

Input constraints:

```
0 <= h <= 23
0 <= m <= 59
0 <= s <= 59
```

---

### Solution 1:

```python
def past(h, m, s):
    seconds_to_milis = s * 1000
    minutes_to_milis = m * 60000
    hours_to_milis = h * 3600000
    return seconds_to_milis + minutes_to_milis + hours_to_milis
```

### Solution 2:

```python
def past(h, m, s):
    return (3600*h + 60*m + s) * 1000
```
