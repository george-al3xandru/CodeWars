# Quarter of the year

Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

---

### Solution 1:

```python
def quarter_of(month):
    if month <= 3:
        return 1
    elif month <= 6:
        return 2
    elif month <= 9:
        return 3
    else:
        return 4
```

### Solution 2:

```python
from math import ceil
def quarter_of(month):
    return ceil(month / 3)
```
